# gui-kiosk

Remote GUI Delivery Stack for Creative and Technical Applications

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Background

`gui-kiosk` was created to provide easy, browser-based access to powerful Linux GUI applications like Blender, intended for users operating from non-Linux systems.  
Originally built to help my nephew reach 3D creative tools for a new 3D printer, it has evolved into a lightweight, modular deployment stack for self-hosted environments.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Lightweight footprint, minimal x11 stack served from noVNC
- Secure local or remote access via web browser
- Designed for headless servers and private labs
- Easily extendable for additional GUI applications (e.g., GIMP, Krita, Inkscape)

---

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Designed for single-responsibility container maintenance.
- Defaults to installing and serving Blender
- Future expansion aims at broader GUI app availability and performance.
- Focused on full self-hosting and local privacy.
